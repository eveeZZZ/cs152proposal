# Differential equation solver

## Project Description
I am planning to create and train a NN based for solving differential equations. This NN will get an input of ODE, either give analytic solution if exists, or give a good approximation of the solution in a simple form. 
This project will be helpful for incorporating NN into many complex simulations for physics and mathematics. 
The longterm goal is to have a quick and accurate ODE solver, which produces good analytic results in most simplified forms, and approximate the unsolvable ODEs in forms that are readable and easily interpreted. 
It would also be helpful to be able to test the limits of the NN in solving higher order ODEs, or its usefulness in tackling PDEs as well. 

## Project Goals

1. Find analytic ODE solution to simple and solvable equations
2. Find approximation solutions in simple forms for the unlovable ODEs
3. Explore limits and solve higher order ODEs
